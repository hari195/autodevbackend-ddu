title: Communication Middleware
description: >
  This feature implements a communication middleware layer for the vehicle
  infotainment system that provides inter-process communication (IPC), message
  routing, and service-to-service communication capabilities. The middleware
  supports publish-subscribe patterns, request-response patterns, and event
  broadcasting. It ensures reliable message delivery, handles message queuing,
  and provides connection management for distributed system components. The
  middleware abstracts communication protocols and provides a unified API for
  system services to communicate regardless of their physical location or
  underlying transport mechanism.
