title: Audio Support
description: >
  This feature provides comprehensive audio support for the vehicle infotainment
  system, including audio playback, audio routing, volume control, and audio
  mixing capabilities. The feature supports multiple audio sources including
  media playback, navigation prompts, phone calls, and system notifications.
  Audio routing manages which audio sources are active and how they are mixed
  together, with priority-based mixing that ensures critical audio (e.g.,
  navigation, phone calls) can interrupt or mix with lower-priority audio
  sources. The feature includes hardware abstraction for audio drivers and
  provides a unified audio API for system services.
