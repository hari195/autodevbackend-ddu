title: ECU Shutdown Sequence
description: >
  This feature implements the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) graceful shutdown sequence
  for the vehicle infotainment system. The shutdown process ensures that all user
  preferences, session state, and critical data are persisted to non-volatile storage
  before the system powers down. The shutdown sequence terminates all services in the
  correct reverse dependency order, closes active applications, and manages state
  transitions from READY → SHUTTING_DOWN → OFF. The shutdown sequence must complete
  within 3 seconds and maintains data integrity even if the shutdown process is
  interrupted. State transitions during shutdown are atomic, preventing new commands
  from being accepted during critical shutdown operations.
