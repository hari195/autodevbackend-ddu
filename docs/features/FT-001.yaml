title: ECU Startup Sequence
description: >
  This feature implements the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) startup sequence for
  the vehicle infotainment system. The startup process begins when power is
  applied to the ECU and follows a predefined initialization sequence that
  includes hardware initialization, service discovery, component registration,
  and service availability verification. The system transitions through states
  (OFF → INITIALIZING → READY) following a state machine pattern, with error
  handling and recovery mechanisms that can transition to SAFE_MODE if critical
  services fail to initialize. The startup sequence must complete within 5
  seconds from power-on, and the system provides visual feedback during the
  initialization process.
