title: "Audio Source Priority and Interruption Test"
description: |
  Verify that audio source priority rules are correctly enforced. Test that
  high-priority audio sources (phone calls, navigation prompts) can interrupt
  lower-priority sources (media playback) and that interrupted sources resume
  correctly when high-priority audio completes. Verify that multiple sources
  can coexist when their priorities allow.
