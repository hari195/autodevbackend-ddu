title: ECU Startup Sequence
description: >
  This feature implements the ECU (Electronic Control Unit) startup sequence for the
  vehicle infotainment system. The startup process begins when power is applied to
  the ECU and follows a predefined initialization sequence that includes hardware
  initialization, service discovery, component registration, and service availability
  verification. The system transitions through states (OFF → INITIALIZING → READY)
  following a state machine pattern, with error handling and recovery mechanisms that
  can transition to SAFE_MODE if critical services fail to initialize. The startup
  sequence must complete within 5 seconds from power-on, and the system provides
  visual feedback during the initialization process.
