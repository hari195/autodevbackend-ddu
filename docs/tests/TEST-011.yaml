title: "Audio Playback and Routing Test"
description: |
  Verify that audio from different sources (media, navigation, phone,
  notifications) is correctly routed to appropriate output channels. Test
  priority-based routing where high-priority audio (phone, navigation) can
  interrupt or mix with lower-priority audio (media). Verify audio quality and
  absence of artifacts during routing transitions.
